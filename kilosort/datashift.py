    The model for row `n` (a batch in segment `s`) and depth block `j` is

                         + sum_k amplitude[s, j, k] * g_{s,k}(t[n])

    where each segment has its own shapes `g_{s,k}`, shared by all depth
    blocks of that segment. So every segment can follow its own course, while
    the blocks of a segment move together, each by its own amount. The shapes
    are weighted sums of Gaussian bumps across time, `g_{s,k} = sum_m
    weights[s, k, m] * phi_m`. The basis is mean-subtracted over the time
    range, so that a constant cannot hide in a shape; per-segment levels go in
    `intercept`.

    Segments are fit independently. Within a segment, fitting alternates
    between weighted least squares for (intercept, amplitude) given the
    shapes, and for the shape weights given the amplitudes, with Huber weights
    updated in between. It is initialized with the leading singular vectors of

    t : np.ndarray
        Time of each row within its segment. `apply_drift_shape` uses the
        position within the segment (0 to 1), so that the bumps span each
        segment separately.
    n_seg : int
        Number of segments. Segments without rows get zero intercept,
        amplitude and shape weights.
    time_range : tuple of float
        Time range covered by the basis. Should include every time the model
        will be evaluated at.
    rank : int; default=1.
        Number of shapes per segment. `rank = J` lets every block of a
        segment follow its own course.
    n_basis : int; default=8.
        Number of Gaussian bumps per shape.
    resolution : float; default=0.5.
        Smallest meaningful residual, in microns. Floors the robust scale.
    max_iter : int; default=50.
    tol : float; default=1e-6.
        Stop when shape weights change by less than this.
